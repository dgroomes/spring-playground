### `caching/`

A basic implementation of caching in Spring. In particular, it illustrates the [Spring Boot production ready caching metrics](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-metrics-cache) 
that are automatically enabled for the caches.

See [caching/README.md](caching/README.md).
