## Standalone sub-projects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the sub-projects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The sub-projects include:

### `caching/`

A basic Spring Boot application that showcases caching.

See the README in [caching/](caching/).

### `scheduling/`

A basic Spring Boot application that showcases scheduling using the [`@Scheduled`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/Scheduled.html) annotation.

See the README in [scheduling/](scheduling/).

### `config/`

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Showcasing various configuration features of Spring Boot and the Spring Framework.

See the README in [config/](config/).
