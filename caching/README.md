# caching

A basic Spring Boot application that showcases caching.

---

Spring Boot (<https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot>) has a significant amount of software machinery around
caching ([relevant section in docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-caching))
. This project aims to de-mystify and illuminate it. Let's learn something!

### Instructions

* Use Java 11
* Source the `commands.sh` file
    * See [`commands.sh`](#commandssh)
* Build and run the program:
    * `build && run`

### `commands.sh`

Source the `commands.sh` file using `source commands.sh` which will load your shell with useful commands. Commands
include:

* `build` build
* `run` run the app

### Commentary

Here is a gentle reminder: Spring Framework provides abstractions over other technologies. For example, read this quote
from <https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache-strategies>:

> As with other services in the Spring Framework, the caching service is an abstraction (not a cache implementation) and requires the use of actual storage to store the cache dataâ€“that is, the abstraction frees you from having to write the caching logic but does not provide the actual data store.

This `caching/` sub-project of the `spring-playground/` project demonstrates Spring's caching abstraction in action.
Specifically it shows how to use the abstraction in the application code with the convenient `@Cacheable` annotation and
how the abstraction layer does not extend to the *configuration* of the underlying caching technology (in this case
<https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine>). This might be considered a *leaky abstraction*.

For reference, here are the two sections in the Spring Boot documentation that describe how to set up basic caching plus
basic metrics. They are:

* <https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-caching>
* <https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-metrics-cache>
* Bonus. Spring *Framework* documentation about
  caching: <https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.8.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#cache>

I think I need to enable statistics in the Caffeine cache. I found that via Googling, in the Caffeine official docs on
the GitHub repo: <https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Statistics>.

The application prints the stack trace from inside a `@Cacheable`-annotated method to illustrate the layers of Spring
and Spring Boot machinery between your application code and the `java` command used to run your application. In
particular, there are layers of generated classes, layers of method calls from classes in the `org.springframework.aop`
package (AOP stands for Aspect-Oriented Programming), and layers of method calls from classes in
the `org.springframework.cache.interceptor`
package. It looks like this:

This demo application enables caching metrics (after two days of head scratching I got it figured out). The metrics can
be conveniently browsed in the Spring Boot Actuator '/metrics' endpoint. Run the app and explore the cache metrics with,
for example:

* `curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/cache.size`
* `curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/cache.evictions`
* `curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/cache.puts` why is this always 0? Does Caffeine not
  track puts? I guess puts could be inferred from misses?
* `curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/cache.gets`
* `curl --request GET --url 'http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/cache.gets?tag=cache%3Afortune&tag=result%3Ahit'`
  drill down on cache hits
* `curl --request GET --url 'http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/cache.gets?tag=cache%3Afortune&tag=result%3Amiss'`
  drill down on cache misses
